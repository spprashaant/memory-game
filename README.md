## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play

Click on any one of the cards in the deck. Then click on another card. If the cards match, then the cards will remain flipped. Otherwise, the cards will hidden again.
The goal of the game is to match all the cards. Every few moves, one of the stars will be removed. Try to match all the cards with maximum stars and minimum time. All the best!
